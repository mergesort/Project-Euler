Hi, this is my Objective-C implementation of Project Euler.
More info can be found at http://projecteuler.net, and the problems at http://projecteuler.net/problems.

This is not all of the solutions, but the ones I have done so far.  You'll be able to see my progress through the commits I make.
For starters the solutions for 1-7 (except #3) will be posted.  The more commits, the more solutions.

Please feel free to leave me ideas on how to optimize my solutions, as I'm sure they are not perfect.

-Joe.
